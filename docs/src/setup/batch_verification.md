# Batch verification (2FA)

Batch verification requires each batch generated by main node to be signed-of by 
certain number of designated ENs before its committed on L1. To enable it configure as follows.

Main node / sequencer:
- `batch_verification_server_enabled=true` -- enable
- `batch_verification_threshold` -- required number of ENs to sign each batch
- `batch_verification_accepted_signers` -- comma separated list of eth addresses corresponding to EN keys 

Participating ENs:
- `batch_verification_client_enabled=true` -- enable
- `batch_verification_connect_address` -- ip and port of main node verification server (eg. `10.10.1.1:1234`)
- `batch_verification_signing_key` -- EN private key

/// This storage serves as a source of truth about blocks executed in the past by the sequencer. No
/// block is considered canonical until it becomes a part of the replay storage. Likewise, a block
/// added to replay storage is considered to be canonical and immutable.
///
/// Node components SHOULD rely on this storage for all purposes related to historical block
/// execution. They MAY rely on other sources to expose information about mined blocks, transactions
/// and state changes as long as it is expected that the information MAY change if a different block
/// gets appended to replay storage.
///
/// All methods in this trait use RFC-2119 keywords to describe their requirements. These
/// requirements must hold for an unspecified period of time that is no less than `self`'s lifetime.
/// This is left ambiguous on purpose to allow both in-memory and persistent implementations, hence
/// any specific implementation SHOULD declare if it satisfies requirements for a longer period of
/// time.
